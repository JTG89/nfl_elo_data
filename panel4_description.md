The QBs All-Time Panel allows the user to explore the trends across the entire career of an NFL Quarterback.

Start by selecting the QB of interest from the drop-down menu, or begin typing in the drop-down box to get suggestions that match what you have typed.  Once you have selected a player, the career record box will populate, showing the career record of that QB broken up by home or away, with his team favored or as the underdog, and as the higher or lower rated QB in the game.  Below the record listings, a histogram is also populated, showing the distribution of career Elo ratings for that team in the range of all team Elo ratings from throughout the Super Bowl Era.

The main plot shows one of several statistics for the QB of interest, tracked across the entirety of his career.  When the plot first loads, the data will seem very congested, particularly for quarterbacks who have had long careers in the league.  Fortunately, the figure was built with [Plotly](https://plotly.com/r/), and has interactive pan and zoom features!

You can click and drag anywhere on the plot to select a boxed region to zoom in on.  To return to the default zoom, double-click anywhere on the plot.  In addition, by clicking and dragging in the middle of the x-axis, the plot will track forward or backward in time, allowing you to explore the long carers of some of the NFL's most successful quarterbacks.  Finally, by clicking on the far right or far left of the x-axis and dragging the mouse, you can change the scale on the plot to pinch the data in tighter, or zoom in further.
