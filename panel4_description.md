The QBs All-Time Panel allows the user to explore the trends across the entire career of an NFL Quarterback.

Start by selecting the QB of interest from the dropdown menu, or begin typing in the dropdown box to get suggestions tat match what you have typed.  Once you have selected a player, the career record box will populate, showing the career record of that QB broken up by home or away, with his team favored or as the underdog, and as the higher or lower rated QB in the game.  Below the record listings, a histogram is also populated, showing the range of career Elo Ratings for that player in the range of all NFL QBs who have played in the Super Bowl Era.

The main plot displayed in this panel shows one of several statistics for the BQ of interest, tracked across the entirety of his career.  Because some of the players listed have had long and successful NFL careers, this plot will extend well off of the screen to the right when it first populates.  This is helpful, as individual games in a season are visually distinct, but later years of the player's career are not visible.  Fortunately, the figure was built with [Plotly](https://plotly.com/r/), and has interactive pan and zoom features!

You can click and drag anywhere on the plot to select a boxed region to zoom in on.  To return to the default zoom, double-click anywhere on the plot.  In addition, by clicking and dragging on the x-axis, the plot will track forward or backward in time, allowing you to explore the long carers of some of the NFL's most successful quarterbacks.  Finally, by clicking on the far right or far left of th x-axis and dragging the mouse, you can change the scale on the plot to pinch the data in tighter, or zoom in further.
