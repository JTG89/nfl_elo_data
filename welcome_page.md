# Welcome to the NFL Team and QB Performance Analysis Tool!

This tool is used for visualizing the performance of each NFL team and quarterback to play in the league from the start of the Super Bowl Era through the 2020 season, using data from FiveThirtyEight.  I invite you to read more about FiveThirtyEight's project from which this data was sourced, [*The Complete History of the NFL*](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-the-nfl/).

Both *The Complete History of the NFL* and this application use Elo ratings as a quantitative measure of each team's likelihood of victory relative to each other team within the bounds of a given season.  The same is true of quarterbacks; each is rated using the Elo rating system relative to the other quarterbacks in the league over the course of that season.  Elo ratings were originally developed to rank chess players relative to each other, and the history and development of this ranking system can be found at the [Elo Ranking Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system).  How FiveThirtyEight calculates these ratings at the beginning of each season and adjusts them as the season progresses can be found at this excellent page explaining their [methodology](https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-our-nfl-predictions-work/).  However, if you're more of the "I want to play around with the numbers and I'll get a feel for how this all works" type of person, please see the **Elo Rating Sandbox** tab at the far right of the tab panel and enjoy!
