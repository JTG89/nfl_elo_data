The QB Performance by Season visualization page tracks the Elo ratings of a given quarterback across a single NFL season.

Start by selecting a season from the dropdown menu, then choose the QB you are interested in.  The side bar will display the record of the selected player for that season, and break the record down by home or away, games in which the team was favored or the underdog, and games in which that player was the higher-rated or lower-rated QB.

The main panel shows an interactive plot of the player's Elo ratings as the season progressed. The user can choose either Regular Season, Playoffs, or both to visualize how the player performed over the course of the season.  The player's interactive ratings are superimposed on a distribution, called a violin plot, of the QB Elo ratings from across the NFL for each week, to show where that player stood relative to the rest of the league at that point in time.

When you mouse over the individual weeks of the season, the game result for that week will appear, along with the opponent, the pre- and post-game Elo ratings for the QB and his team, and their pregame percentage chance of winning, based on the Elo ratings of each team.
