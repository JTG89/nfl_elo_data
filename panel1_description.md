The Team Performance by Season visualization page tracks the Elo ratings of a given team across a single NFL season.

Start by selecting a season from the dropdown menu, then choose the team you are interested in.  The side bar will display the record of the selected team for the selected season, and break the record down by home or away, games in which the team was favored or the underdog, and games in which that team had the higher-rated QB or the lower-rated QB.

The main panel shows an interactive plot of the team's Elo ratings as the season progressed.  Select whether you would like to view the team's base Elo rating, or QB-adjusted Elo rating, which adds an additional weight to the team Elo rating based on their QB's rating.  Then choose either Regular Season, Playoffs, or both to visualize how the team's rating changed over the course of the season.  The team's interactive ratings are superimposed on a distribution, called a violin plot, of the team Elo ratings from across the NFL for each week, to show where the team stood relative to the rest of the league at that point in time.

When you mouse over the individual weeks of the season, the game result for that week will appear, in addition to their QB and opponent for that week, the pre- or post-game Elo ratings for the team you have selected and the opponent, and their pregame percentage chance of winning, based on the Elo ratings of each team.
